**Topic**: Statistical Mechanics & Quantum Mechanics  
**Duration**: 3 hours

## Part 1: Introduction & Statistical Mechanics Foundations (1–1.5 hours)  

### 1. Introduction to Molecular Modeling (15 mins) 
The use of computational and theoretical methods to simulate, visualize, and predict the behavior of molecules and biomolecular systems (e.g., proteins, DNA, ligands) at atomic or molecular scales. The molecular modeling is "computational microscope" that reveals atomic details invisible to lab experiments.
- Simulates:
  - Structure: 3D arrangement of atoms (e.g., protein-ligand binding sites).
  - Dynamics: Movement over time (e.g., protein folding, conformational changes).
  - Interactions: Forces between atoms/molecules (e.g., hydrogen bonds, van der Waals).
- Mimics real-world behavior but requires approximations due to computational limits.

- Applications:
  - Drug Design: Rational drug design: Predict how a drug candidate binds to a target protein (e.g., HIV protease inhibitors).
  - Virtual screening: Test millions of compounds computationally to find potential drugs.
    Example: Development of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) against influenza neuraminidase.
  - Protein Folding:
    - Study how proteins fold into functional 3D structures (e.g., alpha-helices, beta-sheets).
    - Relevance: Misfolded proteins cause diseases like Alzheimer’s (amyloid plaques).
      Example: Folding@Home project crowdsources simulations to study folding pathways.
  - Material Science:
    - Design new materials (e.g., polymers, catalysts, nanomaterials).
      Example: Modeling graphene’s electronic properties for battery technology.
  - Bonus Application:
    - Enzyme Catalysis: Simulate how enzymes accelerate reactions (e.g., lysozyme breaking bacterial cell walls).
    
### 2. Statistical Mechanics Basics (45–60 mins)  
- Directly tracking every atom in a macroscopic system (e.g., 10²³ particles) is computationally impossible.  
- **Solution**: Use **statistical mechanics** to link microscopic details to macroscopic observables.  

#### **1. Microscopic vs. Macroscopic Systems**  
- **Microscopic**:  
  - Describes individual atoms/molecules and their interactions.  
  - Example: Positions, velocities, and energies of all atoms in a protein.  
  - Governed by **Newtonian mechanics** (MD) or **quantum mechanics** (for electrons).  

- **Macroscopic**:  
  - Describes bulk properties (e.g., temperature, pressure, entropy).  
  - Example: The melting point of a material or the binding free energy of a drug.  
  - Governed by **thermodynamics**.
  
  
- **Key Equations**:  
  - Boltzmann distribution: `P_i = e^(-E_i / k_B T)` 
  - Partition function: `Q = Σ e^(-E_i / k_B T)`
  - Free energy: `F = -k_B T ln Q`  
- **Ensembles**:  
  - Microcanonical (NVE), Canonical (NVT), Isothermal-Isobaric (NPT).  
- **Simulation Methods**:  
  - Molecular Dynamics (Newtonian mechanics).  
  - Monte Carlo (random sampling + Boltzmann weights).  

**Example**: MD simulation video of a protein in water.

## Part 2: Quantum Mechanics Basics (1–1.5 hours)  

### 1. Why QM in Molecular Modeling? (15 mins)  
- **Classical Mechanics Limitations**: Covalent bonds, electron transfer.  
- **Applications**:  
  - Chemical reactions (enzyme catalysis), electronic structure (DFT), QM/MM hybrid methods.  

### 2. Quantum Mechanics Essentials (45–60 mins)  
- **Schrödinger Equation**: `Ĥψ = Eψ`  
- **Key Concepts**:  
  - Wavefunctions, orbitals, Born-Oppenheimer approximation.  
- **Computational Methods**:  
  - Hartree-Fock (mean-field theory).  
  - Density Functional Theory (DFT): `E[ρ]` as a functional of electron density.  
- **Accuracy vs. Cost**: Ab initio vs. semi-empirical methods.  

**Example**: Compare QM (DFT) and classical (MD) simulations of H₂O.

- **Workflow**:  
  1. QM for ligand-receptor electronic interactions.  
  2. MD for binding dynamics (statistical sampling).  
  3. Free energy calculations (FEP/TI).  

### 2. Tools & Software (10 mins)  
- **QM**: Gaussian, ORCA, CP2K.  
- **MD**: GROMACS, AMBER, NAMD.  
- **Hybrid QM/MM**: CHARMM, Q-Chem.  

### 3. Challenges & Future Directions (10 mins)  
- Scalability of QM for large systems.  
- Machine learning in force fields.

## Interactive Elements  
- **Live Demo**: Energy minimization/MD setup (if possible).  
- **Conceptual Questions**:  
  - *Why can’t we model electrons classically?*  
  - *What does the partition function reveal about entropy?*  
- **Equation Walkthrough**: Derive Boltzmann distribution from entropy maximization.

## Key Equations to Highlight  
1. `P_i = e^(-E_i / k_B T) / Q` (Boltzmann distribution)  
2. `F = U - TS` (Free energy)  
3. `Ĥψ = Eψ` (Schrödinger equation)  
4. `E[ρ]` determines ground-state properties (Hohenberg-Kohn theorem).
