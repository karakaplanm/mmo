# Lecture Plan: Physical Foundations of Molecular Modeling  
**Topic**: Statistical Mechanics & Quantum Mechanics  
**Duration**: 3 hours  

---

## Part 1: Introduction & Statistical Mechanics Foundations (1–1.5 hours)  

### 1. Introduction to Molecular Modeling (15 mins) 
The use of computational and theoretical methods to simulate, visualize, and predict the behavior of molecules and biomolecular systems (e.g., proteins, DNA, ligands) at atomic or molecular scales. The molecular modeling is "computational microscope" that reveals atomic details invisible to lab experiments.
- Simulates:
  - Structure: 3D arrangement of atoms (e.g., protein-ligand binding sites).
  - Dynamics: Movement over time (e.g., protein folding, conformational changes).
  - Interactions: Forces between atoms/molecules (e.g., hydrogen bonds, van der Waals).
- Mimics real-world behavior but requires approximations due to computational limits.
    
- **Definition**: Simulating molecular systems to predict structure, dynamics, and interactions.
  
- **Applications**:  
  - Drug design, protein folding, material science.  
- **Key Physical Foundations**:  
  - Thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics.  

### 2. Statistical Mechanics Basics (45–60 mins)  
- **Microscopic vs. Macroscopic**: Ensemble averages (energy, entropy).  
- **Key Equations**:  
  - Boltzmann distribution: `P_i = e^(-E_i / k_B T)` 
  - Partition function: `Q = Σ e^(-E_i / k_B T)`
  - Free energy: `F = -k_B T ln Q`  
- **Ensembles**:  
  - Microcanonical (NVE), Canonical (NVT), Isothermal-Isobaric (NPT).  
- **Simulation Methods**:  
  - Molecular Dynamics (Newtonian mechanics).  
  - Monte Carlo (random sampling + Boltzmann weights).  

**Example**: MD simulation video of a protein in water.

## Part 2: Quantum Mechanics Basics (1–1.5 hours)  

### 1. Why QM in Molecular Modeling? (15 mins)  
- **Classical Mechanics Limitations**: Covalent bonds, electron transfer.  
- **Applications**:  
  - Chemical reactions (enzyme catalysis), electronic structure (DFT), QM/MM hybrid methods.  

### 2. Quantum Mechanics Essentials (45–60 mins)  
- **Schrödinger Equation**: `Ĥψ = Eψ`  
- **Key Concepts**:  
  - Wavefunctions, orbitals, Born-Oppenheimer approximation.  
- **Computational Methods**:  
  - Hartree-Fock (mean-field theory).  
  - Density Functional Theory (DFT): `E[ρ]` as a functional of electron density.  
- **Accuracy vs. Cost**: Ab initio vs. semi-empirical methods.  

**Example**: Compare QM (DFT) and classical (MD) simulations of H₂O.

## Interactive Elements  
- **Live Demo**: Energy minimization/MD setup (if possible).  
- **Conceptual Questions**:  
  - *Why can’t we model electrons classically?*  
  - *What does the partition function reveal about entropy?*  
- **Equation Walkthrough**: Derive Boltzmann distribution from entropy maximization.

## Key Equations to Highlight  
1. `P_i = e^(-E_i / k_B T) / Q` (Boltzmann distribution)  
2. `F = U - TS` (Free energy)  
3. `Ĥψ = Eψ` (Schrödinger equation)  
4. `E[ρ]` determines ground-state properties (Hohenberg-Kohn theorem).
